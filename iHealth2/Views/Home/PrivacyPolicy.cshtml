                            <br /> Data transmissions over the Internet are not 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. Your account information is also password-protected.
                            <br /> In certain areas, Ihealth uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions (such as when entering credit card details). However, this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of a firewall or secure server software.
                            <br />If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Service or providing personal information to us, you are consenting to our communicating with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues related to your use of the Service. We may post a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the applicable web sites. In these circumstances, we may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you have to submit a request through our help centre.
